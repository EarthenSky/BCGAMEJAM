Here's some platform components I want to add tomorrow:

Bomb block - represents unexploded ordanance from the spaceship
- Interacting with the block will push the player away from the block (ie jumping on it will blast the player up, hitting it from below will push the player away)
- Like a bumper
- Enemies will not trigger bombs

Turret block - where projectiles will be shot
- Turrets should be clearly labelled
- Contacting a turret will not kill

Spike/instant-kill block - nuff said
- make platforming more difficult
